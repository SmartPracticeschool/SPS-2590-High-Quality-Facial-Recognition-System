# SPS-2590-High-Quality-Facial-Recognition-System
## The One With The Facial Recognition

Facial recognition is the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person using their face. It captures, analyzes, and compares patterns based on the person's facial details. High-Quality Facial Recognition System has many applications starting from mobile phones to security cameras. The face detection process is an essential step as it detects and locates human faces in images and videos.

In this project we will build a Facial Recognization application that can detect faces of the core characters of the 90's sitcom F.R.I.E.N.D.S and recognize them. We are going to build this using dlib which uses 128 point face detectors which outputs these 128 points fro all the face and compares them with existing faces.

Happy Learning!
